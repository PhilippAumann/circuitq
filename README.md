# CircuitQ
## Simulation and analysis of superconducting circuits

CircuitQ is an an open-source toolbox for the analysis of superconducting circuits implemented in Python. It features the automated construction of a symbolic Hamiltonian of the input circuit, as well as a dynamic numerical representation of this Hamiltonian with a variable basis choice. Additional features include the estimation of the T1 lifetimes of the circuit states under various noise mechanisms. The circuit quantization is both applicable to circuit inputs from a large design space and open-source.
